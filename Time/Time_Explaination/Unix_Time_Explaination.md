# Unix time - Explaination

Started on "January 1, 1970"


In computing, Unix time (also known as Epoch time, Posix time, seconds since the Epoch, 
Unix timestamp or UNIX Epoch time) is a system for describing a point in time. 
It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, excluding leap seconds. 

The Unix epoch started at 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
It has been calculated that, for 32 bits Computers, the UNIX Epoch will end at 03:14:07 UTC on the 19th January 2038.

Unix time is not a true representation of UTC, because a leap second and the second before it 
have the same Unix time (or after it, implementation dependent). 

Put differently, every day in Unix time contains exactly 86400 seconds; 
no seconds added to or subtracted from the day as a result of positive or negative leap seconds.

Unix time originally appeared as the system time of Unix, but is now used widely in computing, 
for example by filesystems; some Python language library functions handle Unix time.

# The 'Y2K' Problem - (a.k.a. Millennium Bug)

The year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem, Y2K scare, millennium bug, Y2K bug, 
Y2K glitch, Y2K error, or simply Y2K refers to potential computer errors related to 
the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates in and after the year 2000. 
Many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits, 
making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. 
Computer systems' inability to distinguish dates correctly had the potential to bring down 
worldwide infrastructures for industries ranging from banking to air travel.

In the years leading up to the turn of the century (millennium), the public gradually became 
aware of the "Y2K scare", and individual companies predicted the global damage caused by the bug 
would require anything between $400 million and $600 billion to rectify. 
A lack of clarity regarding the potential dangers of the bug led some to stock up on food, water, 
and arms, purchase backup generators, and withdraw large sums of money in anticipation of a computer-induced apocalypse.

Contrary to public expectations, few major errors actually occurred in 2000. 
Supporters of the Y2K remediation effort argued that this was primarily due to the pre-emptive 
action of many computer programmers and information technology experts. 
Companies and organizations in some countries, but not all, had checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems 
to address the problem. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton, who organized efforts to minimize the damage in the United States, 
labeled Y2K as "the first challenge of the 21st century successfully met", 
and retrospectives on the event typically commend the programmers who worked to avert the anticipated disaster.

Critics pointed out that even in countries where very little had been done to fix software, problems were minimal. 
The same was true in sectors such as schools and small businesses where compliance with Y2K policies was patchy at best.
